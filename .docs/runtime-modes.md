# Runtime modes

Trellis exposes three runtime modes in the permission picker:

- **Supervised**: asks the user before protected actions. Codex uses
  `approvalPolicy: untrusted`, `sandbox: read-only`, and
  `approvalsReviewer: user`. Claude Code uses its default permission mode.
- **Auto** (Codex and Claude Code): lets an AI reviewer handle routine approvals;
  higher-risk actions may be blocked or escalated to the user. Codex uses
  `approvalPolicy: on-request`, `sandbox: workspace-write`, and
  `approvalsReviewer: auto_review`. Claude Code uses `permissionMode: auto`
  without `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions`.
- **Full access** (default): bypasses interactive approval. Codex uses
  `approvalPolicy: never`, `sandbox: danger-full-access`, and
  `approvalsReviewer: user`. Claude Code uses
  `permissionMode: bypassPermissions` with
  `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions: true`.

The reviewer is sent explicitly on every Codex thread start, resume, fork, and
turn so switching away from Auto cannot inherit a sticky auto-review setting.
Auto is only offered for providers with a native AI-review implementation.
Codex Auto requires CLI `0.131.0-alpha.9` or newer.
Claude Code Auto requires CLI `2.1.83` or newer and a model/account where the
SDK reports Auto support.
