# Scripts

- `bun run dev` — Starts contracts, server, and web in `turbo watch` mode.
- `bun run dev:server` — Starts just the WebSocket server (uses Bun TypeScript execution).
- `bun run dev:web` — Starts just the Vite dev server for the web app.
- Dev commands default `TRELLIS_HOME` to `~/.trellis`, which keeps dev state under `~/.trellis/dev`.
- Override server CLI-equivalent flags from root dev commands with `--`, for example:
  `bun run dev -- --home-dir ~/.trellis-2`
- `bun run start` — Runs the production server (serves built web app as static files).
- `bun run build` — Builds contracts, web app, and server through Turbo.
- `bun run typecheck` — Strict TypeScript checks for all packages.
- `bun run test` — Runs workspace tests.
- `bun run dist:desktop:artifact -- --platform <mac|linux|win> --target <target> --arch <arch>` — Builds a desktop artifact for a specific platform/target/arch.
- `bun run dist:desktop:dmg` — Builds a shareable macOS `.dmg` into `./release`.
- `bun run dist:desktop:dmg:x64` — Builds an Intel macOS `.dmg`.
- `bun run dist:desktop:linux` — Builds a Linux AppImage into `./release`.
- `bun run dist:desktop:win` — Builds a Windows NSIS installer into `./release`.

## Development compilation

The Vite development server skips React Compiler by default so cold page loads
and edits to large chat components do not wait for compiler optimization. JSX,
TypeScript and React Fast Refresh still run through Vite's normal React plugin.
Production builds and browser tests (`test` mode) always use React Compiler.

To investigate compiler-specific behavior or compare rendering performance with
compiler memoization enabled, opt in before starting the dev server:

```bash
TRELLIS_DEV_REACT_COMPILER=1 bun run dev:desktop
# Also applies to bun run dev and bun run dev:web.
```

Restart the dev command after changing this flag. Default development rendering
does not have compiler-generated memoization, so use a production build or the
opt-in when measuring rendering performance.

## Desktop `.dmg` packaging notes

- Default local builds are unsigned/not notarized unless `--signed` is supplied with the required platform credentials.
- Production icon sources are centralized in `scripts/lib/brand-assets.ts`. The current macOS source is `assets/prod/black-macos-1024.png` (with the legacy macOS variant alongside it); do not hard-code a separate packaging icon path in docs or scripts.
- Desktop production windows load the bundled UI from `trellis://app/index.html` (not a `127.0.0.1` document URL).
- Desktop packaging includes `apps/server/dist` (the `trellis` backend) and starts it on loopback with an auth token for WebSocket/API traffic.
- Your tester can still open an unsigned local macOS build by right-clicking the app and choosing **Open** on first launch.
- To keep staging files for debugging package contents, run: `bun run dist:desktop:dmg -- --keep-stage`.
- To enable code-signing/notarization when the required credentials are configured, add `--signed`.
- Windows `--signed` uses Azure Trusted Signing and expects:
  `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME`,
  `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME`, `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_PUBLISHER_NAME`,
  and `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_SUBJECT_DN`.
- Azure authentication env vars are also required (for example a service principal with secret):
  `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- Release publication has stricter signing/provenance policy than a local artifact build; use `docs/release.md` as the source of truth for release requirements.

## Running multiple dev instances

Set `TRELLIS_DEV_INSTANCE` to any value to deterministically shift all dev ports together.

- Default ports: server `3773`, web `5733`
- Shifted ports: `base + offset` (offset is hashed from `TRELLIS_DEV_INSTANCE`)
- Example: `TRELLIS_DEV_INSTANCE=branch-a bun run dev:desktop`

If you want full control instead of hashing, set `TRELLIS_PORT_OFFSET` to a numeric offset.
