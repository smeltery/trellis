# Architecture

Trellis is a local-first orchestration application with three main runtime surfaces:

- the React web client in `apps/web`;
- the server/runtime in `apps/server`;
- the Electron desktop shell in `apps/desktop`.

The server owns durable orchestration, provider sessions, Git/worktree state, terminals, automation, device/browser integrations, and the typed HTTP/WebSocket RPC surface. Provider-native protocols stay behind adapter boundaries; the web app consumes Trellis contracts rather than talking to coding-agent CLIs directly.

## Runtime boundaries

### Web client

`apps/web` renders the application and owns browser-side transport/state coordination.

Important boundaries include:

- `wsTransport.ts` — connection state, negotiation, reconnect, and request transport;
- `wsNativeApi.ts` / `nativeApi.ts` — typed client API exposed to the rest of the UI;
- `routes/__root.tsx` — application-level event/subscription routing and shell/thread projection ownership;
- Zustand/React Query stores that cache or project server-authoritative state;
- client-owned persisted UI state such as unsent composer drafts, sticky local model choices, and right-dock layout, which is not reconstructible from server snapshots.

The client does not own provider session truth or durable orchestration state. When the socket reconnects, snapshots and resumable streams rebuild server-derived client projections, while browser-persisted drafts/layout remain a separate client-owned state class.

### Server and RPC surface

`apps/server/src/wsRpc.ts` is the main typed feature-RPC boundary. It merges the shared contract groups, applies request/stream admission, authentication/session context, and exposes orchestration plus server services on one feature socket.

The HTTP/WebSocket layer also owns:

- protocol negotiation and compatibility fencing;
- trusted-origin/authentication policy;
- static asset delivery;
- bounded stream/backpressure behavior;
- device frame transport and other specialized routes.

`serverLayers.ts` assembles the long-lived service graph used by the server runtime.

### Orchestration

The orchestration layer is provider-independent and durable.

A typical state-changing request follows this shape:

```text
client request
    ↓
OrchestrationEngine command
    ↓
durable event / projection update
    ↓
ProviderCommandReactor (when provider work is required)
    ↓
ProviderService
    ↓
ProviderAdapter
```

Provider output travels back in the opposite direction:

```text
provider-native event
    ↓
ProviderAdapter canonical ProviderRuntimeEvent
    ↓
ProviderRuntimeIngestion
    ↓
orchestration command/event
    ↓
projection stream
    ↓
web client
```

Key files:

- `orchestration/Layers/OrchestrationEngine.ts` — command admission, durable event processing, read-model lifecycle;
- `orchestration/Layers/ProviderCommandReactor.ts` — turns durable provider intents into adapter operations;
- `orchestration/Layers/ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts` — converts canonical runtime events back into durable orchestration state;
- `orchestration/Services/ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts` — authoritative projection reads used by RPC/subscription recovery.

## Provider layer

`ProviderService` is the session-aware routing layer. It resolves the thread/provider relationship and delegates native work through `ProviderAdapterRegistry`.

Each concrete adapter implements the shared contract in `provider/Services/ProviderAdapter.ts` and translates one provider's native protocol into canonical runtime events. `ProviderAdapterRegistryLive` is the source of truth for the currently registered first-class provider set; [provider-architecture.md](./provider-architecture.md) documents the provider boundary and integration patterns but should not be treated as a stronger inventory authority than the registry itself.

Provider-specific session ids, process lifecycle, wire formats, model discovery, approvals, tools, and resume details should stay inside the provider layer whenever possible. Orchestration should depend on capabilities and canonical events rather than provider names.

## Persistence and local resources

Trellis's server owns the local durable state and resource lifecycles:

- SQLite persistence and projections under `apps/server/src/persistence`;
- managed Git/worktree operations under `apps/server/src/git` and checkpointing/orchestration services;
- terminal processes under `apps/server/src/terminal`;
- attachments and workspace files through server-owned filesystem services;
- provider processes/sessions through adapter scopes and provider runtime services.

This ownership is why the web client can reload or reconnect without becoming the source of truth for an active turn.

## Desktop shell

`apps/desktop` is a native host, not a second orchestration implementation. It supervises a desktop-scoped Trellis backend, loads the shared web UI, and provides OS/Electron integrations such as window lifecycle, native menus/shortcuts, updates, and platform-specific bridges.

Browser/web mode and desktop mode therefore share the same server contracts and most UI code.

## Connection and recovery model

The feature socket is negotiated before use and server restarts are fenced by server-instance/protocol compatibility. See [transport.md](./transport.md) for the detailed handshake.

For orchestration state, the client uses two principal subscription shapes:

- a lightweight shell stream for projects/thread summaries and application-level navigation state;
- scoped thread-detail streams for full conversation/activity state.

Streams support snapshot/replay recovery and client-side sequence fences. A late query or replay must not roll the client behind a newer live sequence; when recovery cannot be proven safe, Trellis prefers a fresh snapshot.

## Design rules

When adding a feature, keep these ownership rules explicit:

1. durable domain truth belongs to server orchestration/persistence, not React state; client-owned drafts/layout remain explicitly local;
2. provider-native behavior belongs behind `ProviderAdapter` unless it is genuinely cross-provider orchestration;
3. state-changing side effects should have one authoritative server path and idempotent/replay-safe semantics;
4. client subscriptions may cache/project state but must respect server sequence/version fences;
5. resource lifecycles (processes, worktrees, sessions, streams) need deterministic cleanup and bounded queues/timeouts;
6. shared contracts belong in `packages/contracts`; cross-runtime utilities belong in `packages/shared`.
