/**
 * Device helper cache location, shared by the server and the smoke CLI.
 *
 * The helper links private CoreSimulator/SimulatorKit frameworks whose symbols
 * move between Xcode releases, so a compiled binary is only valid for the
 * toolchain that produced it and the cache is keyed on that toolchain.
 *
 * This lives in `@trellis/shared` because two independent callers derive the
 * same path: `IosSimulatorBackend` (which builds the helper on first attach)
 * and `scripts/device-helper-smoke.ts` (which builds it to verify a release).
 * They previously derived it separately and disagreed, so a passing smoke test
 * populated a directory the server never looked in and the server rebuilt from
 * scratch. One derivation, one directory.
