 * Every shipped Trellis database records its applied migrations as (id, name)
 * rows in `effect_sql_migrations`, and the runtime reconciler in
 * `Migrations.ts` treats a name that does not match the ID as a foreign
 * lineage: it truncates the tracker and replays the schema. Renumbering or
 * renaming a migration that a release already wrote therefore corrupts every
 * database from that release. v0.6.0 moved `ProjectPullRequestPins` from 54 to
 * 69 and did exactly that.
 *
 * Appending new migrations is always safe. This guard rejects changes to pairs
 * any reachable release tag already shipped — not just the newest one, because
 * a database is wedged by the release *it* was created under, and users skip
 * versions. A pair that today's `MIGRATION_LINEAGE_ALIASES` knows how to repair
 * is exempt: that divergence is handled rather than merely present.
