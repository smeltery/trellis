/**
 * Thread-scoped device metadata and deferred pane requests.
 *
 * The live simulator surface is a canvas fed by binary frames; this store keeps
 * the metadata the pane chrome needs (device list, attachment, agent
 * activity, availability) so a thread switch renders instantly and a late push
 * can never roll the pane back to an older generation. Open requests wait here
 * until a chat surface can honor the user's automatic-opening preference.
 *
 * Deliberately not persisted: device boot state is only meaningful while the
 * server that reported it is alive, and a stale "Booted" from last week's
 * session would render a picker that lies.
