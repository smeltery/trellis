// FILE: orchestrationEventCoalescing.ts
// Purpose: Collapse a flush window of orchestration domain events before they reach the
//          store reducer, so N streamed text deltas for one message cost one reducer pass.
// Layer: Web client event pipeline (pure)
// Exports: coalesceOrchestrationUiEvents
// Why: Coalesce text across interleaved threads without moving a thread's state
//      transitions ahead of its other events.
