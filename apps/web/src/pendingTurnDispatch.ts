// FILE: pendingTurnDispatch.ts
// Purpose: Cross-component signal that a thread has a composer turn dispatch
//          the thread event stream has not yet acknowledged.
// Layer: Web subscription utility
// Exports: mark/clear/has helpers consumed by ChatView and the EventRouter
//          catch-up watchdog.

import type { ThreadId } from "@trellis/contracts";

// The catch-up watchdog otherwise re-syncs only threads the store already
// believes are busy. A lost `thread.session-set(running)` event corrupts
// exactly that belief, so the watchdog needs a signal that does not come from
// the store: "the composer dispatched a turn here that the projection has not
// yet confirmed".
//
// Lifecycle — deliberately independent of the composer's own dispatch state,
// which clears on UI-level acknowledgement (message echo, ack fallback) that
// can fire off a stream that then stalls before the running transition:
// - armed when the composer begins a dispatch, and re-armed when the turn RPC
//   resolves (pre-dispatch work like worktree setup can outlive the age cap);
// - cleared at the dispatch site when the turn RPC fails or rollback confirms
//   that no server turn remains;
// - otherwise expired by the age cap below.
const pendingDispatchArmedAtByThreadId = new Map<ThreadId, number>();

// Upper bound on how long a pending dispatch keeps forcing catch-up work.
// Covers both leaked markers and a dispatched turn that settles before the
// watchdog ever observes a busy state (nothing else clears that marker).
