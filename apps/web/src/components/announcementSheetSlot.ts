// FILE: announcementSheetSlot.ts
// Purpose: One shared slot so startup announcement sheets open one at a time.
// Layer: Web UI store
//
// Startup announcements wait for the first-run gate and onboarding to finish, even
// while the onboarding dialog is loading. Beta welcome precedes that gate and opts out.
// Each announcement decides to open from its own asynchronous probe (desktop bridge,
// server config), so no fixed order can be relied on. The first surface that wants to
// open takes the slot; the others wait and open after it is dismissed. Confirming a
// sheet starts its follow-on flow (a dialog, a Settings page), so the waiting sheets
// stay closed for the rest of this launch instead of covering that flow; they are not
// acknowledged, so they come back on the next one.
