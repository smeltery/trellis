/**
 * quitResume - "Resume chats automatically" after a desktop quit.
 *
 * When the user quits the desktop app while chats are running and leaves the
 * "Resume chats automatically" box checked, the renderer calls the
 * `orchestration.prepareQuitResume` RPC *before* answering the quit request.
 * `prepareQuitResume` durably records the listed threads that are genuinely
 * in flight (with the turn that was running at that moment, or none while the
 * provider was still connecting) in a small JSON file next to the other server
 * state, then interrupts those turns. Because the record is written before the
 * renderer replies `allow`, it survives the renderer and the backend being torn
 * down mid-flight; a failed write fails the RPC and the renderer falls back to a
 * plain interrupt-and-quit.
 *
 * A quit can still be cancelled after the record exists (renderer crash, desktop
 * refusing to quit). If this process is still alive `QUIT_RESUME_ABANDON_AFTER_MS`
 * after writing it, the quit evidently did not happen and the record is removed
 * so an unrelated later restart never resumes those chats.
 *
 * At the next server start `claimQuitResumeRecordAtStartup` consumes the record
 * before commands are admitted (so no new quit can race it; atomic rename then
 * delete — a crash in between loses the resume rather than doubling it), then
 * `resumeQuitInterruptedChats` filters out threads that moved on since the record
 * was written and dispatches one ordinary user turn per remaining thread with the
 * recorded continuation prompt. Each turn carries a `resumePrecondition` so the
 * decider re-checks the same conditions atomically inside the serialized
 * dispatch — a client command landing between the plan and the dispatch cannot
 * slip a stale continuation through. No record → one `exists` check and nothing
 * else.
 *
 * Accepted residual windows (all require a second quit or a new turn to land
 * within microseconds of the first): a turn that replaces the recorded one inside
 * the prepare RPC is interrupted and not resumed; a second quit prepared exactly
 * when the first one's abandon sweep fires loses its record.
