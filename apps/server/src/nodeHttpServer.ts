 * permessage-deflate configuration for the feature WS socket only.
 *
 * The RPC stream is small, highly repetitive JSON (repeated schema keys,
 * UUIDs, event envelopes), which is the best case for DEFLATE with context
 * takeover: the compression window is shared across frames, so each frame is
 * coded against the vocabulary of everything sent before it. Context takeover
 * stays enabled (the negotiated default). A client offering
 * `client_no_context_takeover` still compresses normally; one offering
 * `server_no_context_takeover` loses the shared vocabulary and can end up
 * with frames slightly larger than uncompressed, since framing overhead
 * exceeds the gain on a single small frame.
 *
 * No `threshold` is set: `ws` only honors it when context takeover is
 * disabled, and skipping tiny frames would also skip priming the shared
 * window they benefit from.
 *
 * `maxPayload` admission control is unaffected: `ws` enforces it on the
 * decompressed size — accumulated across continuation frames — so a
 * compressed or fragmented message cannot smuggle past the bound.
 *
 * The pre-auth bootstrap socket deliberately never negotiates compression:
 * each actively compressed connection retains zlib window state (~288 KiB at
 * defaults) plus potentially near-`maxPayload` inflated buffers for
 * incomplete fragmented messages, and the bootstrap path is reachable
 * without credentials. Compression is a post-authentication privilege so
 * unauthenticated connections cannot multiply per-connection memory.
 *
 * Measured on a simulated streaming turn of small repetitive JSON frames:
 * ~80% wire reduction, with CPU dominated by per-invocation zlib overhead
 * rather than compression level (levels 1/3/6 within 2% on both axes), so
 * zlib options stay at their defaults. Numbers in the PR that added this.
 *
 * `ws` already defaults `concurrencyLimit` to 10 and creates its limiter
 * once per process on the first PerMessageDeflate instance, so passing it
 * here would pin the default rather than bound anything new.
