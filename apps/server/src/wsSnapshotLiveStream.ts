/**
 * Detects a resnapshot demand that restarting the stream cannot satisfy.
 *
 * A healthy resnapshot cycle strictly advances the snapshot fence: the client
 * restarts, the server serves a fresh snapshot at (or near) the journal head,
 * and the gap closes. When the snapshot fence is frozen — a stalled or missing
 * projector — every restart re-reads the same fence and re-demands the same
 * resnapshot forever. Track the fence of the last demand per stream key; a
 * repeat demand at a non-advancing fence is escalated to a non-retryable
 * failure so clients stop tearing the transport down and surface the fault.
 *
 * Callers must key the tracker per subscriber (client id + stream name), not
 * per stream name alone: two clients demanding the same stale stream
 * concurrently are two first offenses, not one restart cycle — a shared key
 * would hand the second client a non-retryable verdict before either had
 * actually restarted. The fence itself is shared database state, so each
 * subscriber's chain still converges on the same evidence; per-subscriber
 * keying only ensures the "did not advance" comparison spans one
 * subscription's own retries. State is cleared the moment that subscriber's
 * stream start succeeds.
