/**
 * deviceTypeCatalogue - screen geometry and product family, known before boot.
 *
 * The native helper reports a device's real geometry, but only once it has
 * attached to a booted simulator. That is far too late for the pane: picking an
 * iPad from the picker drew an iPhone-shaped chassis until the stream arrived,
 * then snapped to the right shape seconds later.
 *
 * Every simulator device type ships a `profile.plist` carrying `mainScreenWidth`
 * / `mainScreenHeight` / `mainScreenScale`, and `simctl list devicetypes` maps
 * each device to its bundle and product family. Both are readable with the
 * device shut down, so discovery can carry geometry from the first listing.
 *
 * The helper's attachment still wins when it disagrees: it measures the actual
 * framebuffer of the running boot, and that is what input is validated against.
