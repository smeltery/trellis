/**
 * Which simulators Trellis booted, remembered across process death.
 *
 * `DeviceManager` tracks this in memory, which is enough for a clean quit: the
 * finalizer walks the set and shuts each one down. A crash or a SIGKILL runs no
 * finalizer, so the set dies with the process and the simulators outlive it.
 * That was not merely untidy — the orphan reappeared as `bootSource: "user"`,
 * which meant nothing would ever reclaim it: it fell outside the boot cap, the
 * idle sweep, and the next quit's shutdown, all of which are gated on Trellis
 * having booted the device. Each crash leaked one simulator, permanently.
 *
 * The record is a plain JSON file rather than a row in the database because it
 * has to be readable and writable before most of the server exists, and because
 * a corrupt or missing file must degrade to "own nothing" rather than fail a
 * boot. Recovery is deliberately conservative: a device is only reclaimed when
 * it is still booted AND still listed as ours, so a udid the user has since
 * booted themselves is never shut down out from under them.
