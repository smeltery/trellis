/**
 * Seatbelt confinement for the native device helper.
 *
 * The helper dlopens private CoreSimulator/SimulatorKit frameworks and injects
 * HID events driven by a model, with no need for the user's files or the
 * network. `device-helper.sb` takes those away; this module is the single place
 * that knows how to apply it, so the long-lived RPC process and the one-shot
 * `--probe` run are confined identically. Preflighting under different
 * privileges than the real run would let a broken rule pass the checklist and
 * then hang on attach.
 *
 * Every profile parameter is resolved at spawn time rather than hard-coded,
 * because the ones that matter move per machine: Xcode can be a beta or live
 * outside /Applications, and the helper cache is keyed per toolchain.
 *
 * @module device/helperSandbox
